            <p className="story">
            Back in college, I used to get popcorn chicken every once in a while from my favorite boba place in town. I wanted to know if I could make this Taiwanese street food classic in my own 
            kitchen with less effort than it would take to go to the shop and buy some. By making chicken nuggets and tossing them in seasoned sauce, you can get something that may not be 
            quite as good, but it's still absolutely delicious. Whether you want to spice up your chicken nuggets gourmet-style or you want a simplified version of popcorn chicken you can 
            make right at home, this is the recipe for you. So here's my take on a makeshift popcorn chicken.
            </p>
            <p className="story">
            For this recipe, I prefer getting breaded chicken bites or boneless wings for their shape and crunchy texture, but you can use whichever breaded chicken from the freezer aisle that you 
            prefer. Follow the box instructions for making the nuggets and bake them in the oven. In the meantime, make the spice paste for your sauce. This will be a mixture of soy sauce, rice wine 
            vinegar, sugar, and spices. The soy adds saltiness and umami, the vinegar adds acidity, and the sugar adds a little sweetness and helps to thicken the sauce as it reduces. For the spices,
            I like to use a combination of black pepper, white pepper, paprika, five spice powder, chili powder, powdered ginger, and MSG. If you don't have all of these on hand, that's okay, but I 
            would consider the black pepper, white pepper, five spice powder, and ginger to be essential. Black pepper has a nice spicy bite to it, white pepper has a subtle mustiness that I think makes
            meat taste a little more meaty, five spice powder adds warm and sweet aromas, and ginger powder adds subtle heat and some earthiness. Combine the soy and vinegar with the sugar and spices
            until the ingredients dissolve as much as possible to form a paste. Set this aside for later. As a side note, I'm aware that this isn't traditional by any means, but it does taste reminiscent 
            of the chicken I used to get at the boba shop with a few minor tweaks, which was my goal for this recipe.
            </p>

            Warm up some neutral oil in a pan on high heat. While it warms up, get a scallion and separate the white from the green, then slice the greens on a bias. Slicing on a bias just means diagonally,
            to get long, thin slices rather than round ones. This will make the garnish look a little bit fancier than if you were to just cut perpendicularly. Once the oil is hot, take the scallion white and
            whack it a couple times with the flat of your knife to bruise it, then fry it in the oil until it develops a slight char on both sides. Whacking it helps to release the oils and flavor of the 
            scallion, which will infuse the oil. The char develops a nice complex allium flavor and will signal when the scallion has given up a lot of its flavor. Discard the scallion when finished. If you're 
            disheartened at the thought of throwing away perfectly good scallion whites, you can slice them into rounds and toss them with the nuggets in the sauce at the end, or you can just eat them like I do.
            Cooking them will have removed a lot of that raw pungency, so it's not too strong. By now the oil should be hot enough to fry the basil, so add washed and dried basil leaves into the pan. Normally I 
            don't care if you use dry or fresh herbs, but basil loses almost all of its flavor when dried, and the glassy, fried leaves give some gorgeous color contrast to the dish. If you can find Thai basil, 
            I would use that over the sweet basil normally used in Italian and American cooking. Thai basil leaves are a bit more resilient and have a stronger spice aroma with subtle notes of licorice that pair
            wonderfully with the other spices in this dish. Be careful when you add the basil, as the oil will splutter a lot. Fry the leaves for no more than 10 seconds before adding your spice paste. This will 
            cool down the pan and introduce moisture to prevent the basil from burning. Mix throroughly and let the sauce reduce slightly. After a minute or two, take the pan off the heat and add the roughly 
            chopped garlic. The residual heat will gently infuse the garlic flavor into the sauce without burning it. At the boba shop I went to, the garlic chunks were almost raw and retained a ton of their flavor.
            I loved that, but my roommates didn't enjoy that pungent aspect quite as much. Adding the garlic in this way allows the flavor to absorb slowly into the sauce while letting it keep just a touch of its 
            original bite. If you want less of that bite, chop the garlic into smaller pieces instead. That's the neat part about cooking at home: you're the one in control.
            </p>

            By now the nuggets should be done, so take them out of the oven, put them in a large bowl, sprinkle with a bit of salt, and give them a little toss. Pour the sauce over 
            the nuggets, making sure to use a spatula to get out all the powdery bits and every last drop of oil out of the pan. Toss together, making sure all the nuggets get covered in sauce, 
            and then serve hot with the scallion greens as a garnish. This may not be the best popcorn chicken you'll ever have, but I guarantee it'll be the best chicken nuggets of your life.
